    "Now you can adjust which configurations you want to use for your model.\n",
    "All settings have an default value, but you can adjust them, if you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Device settings\n",
    "The `TEM-FAST` device has different settings for the measurements which are also considered for the modelling:\n",
    "- Timekey (`timekey`): integer,  \n",
    "A number from 1 to 9 which determines the number of timegates used. The default is 9.\n",
    "- Selected current (`currentkey`): integer,  \n",
    "If the device should inject 1 or 4 A of current. The default is 1.\n",
    "- Loopsize (`loop`): float,  \n",
    "The side lenght in Meters of the square loop. The default is 12.5.\n",
    "- Injected Current (`current_inj`): float,  \n",
    "If an measurment was performed, the current, which was actually injected by the device can be added here. This resorts to the theoretical injected current (`currentkey`) as the default.\n",
    "- Powerline filter (`filter_powerline`): integer,  \n",
    "If 50 or 60 Hz frequency should be filtered. The default is 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling settings\n",
    "Settings which are relevant for the modelling:\n",
    "- The resistivity model (`model`): numpy.array() or list\n",
    "The model of the layered subsurface containing the thickness and resistivity of each layer.\n",
    "This can be added easier with the `add_resistivity_model()` method.\n",
    "- An absolute error (`absolute_error`): float\n",
    "An absolute error used to simulate a random error. The default is 1e-28.\n",
    "- An relative error (`relative_error`): float\n",
    "A relative error used to simulate a random error. The default is 1e-6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting settings\n",
    "For the creation of the plots more things can be changed:\n",
    "- Add a title to the plot (`plot_title`): str\n",
    "Adds a super title to the whole figure.\n",
    "- Keep plotting on the same figure (`track`): boolean, \n",
    "When modelling different models, the results can be plotted on the same figure or a new figure is created for every model. The default is `False`. This means a new plot is created for each model.\n",
    "- Convert to Conductivity (`res2con`): boolean,  \n",
    "If the results should be plotted as resistivity or conductivity. The default is `False`. This means, that the resistivities are plotted.\n",
    "- Ax limits for time (`time_limits`): tuple of two numbers,  \n",
    "Gives an lower and upper limit for the time axis in the plots. The default is None (`matplotlib` chooses).\n",
    "- Ax limits for signal (`signal_limits`): tuple of two numbers,  \n",
    "Gives an lower and upper limit for the signal axis in the plots. The default is None (`matplotlib` chooses).\n",
    "- Ax limits for apparent resistivity/conductivity (`rhoa_limits`): tuple of two numbers,  \n",
    "Gives an lower and upper limit for the apparent resistivity/conductivity axis in the response plot. The default is None (`matplotlib` chooses).\n",
    "- Ax limits for model resistivity/conductivity (`rho_limits`): tuple of two numbers,  \n",
    "Gives an lower and upper limit for the resistivity/conductivity axis in the model plot. The default is None (`matplotlib` chooses).\n",
    "- Ax limits for model depth (`depth_limits`): tuple of two numbers,  \n",
    "Gives an lower and upper limit for the depth axis in the model plot. The default is None (`matplotlib` chooses).\n",
