Field Notes BrÃ¼nlital TEM campaign 10.07.2025

Test 1: 4A, 24V, Timekey 3, Stack 10; near the entrance of the valley in the middle

Test 2: Timekey 4, Stack 10
-> Test 1 had good results at late times, therefore a longer timekey was tested
-> nearly identical values at the times also measured in the timekey 3, late times also have high errors, therefore time 3 was chosen

Test 3: Time 3, Stack 5
because we had good values and low errors with Stack 10, Stack 15 was not tested
Stack 5 had little bit higher errors than Stack 10, therefore we stuck to stack 10

# all following Soundings were aquired using 4A, 24V, time 3, stack 10

# Measurement area description: likely permafrost area, talus slope
soil, when visible is wet, some snow is still in the valley (marked when in sounding area), otherwise no ice visible
rocks at the higher places in the slope tend to be smaller 0.5-30cm, at the bottom rock tend to be bigger 5-200cm

## Area measurement A was subdivided into 6 profiles A1-A6

B001: Start of profile A1
Coords A1_001-A1_004 - line has coords of scheme A1_0XX
Middle of area, top of north facing side of valley. Fine material, probably no or little permafrost
profile goes down the valley

B007: Start of profile A2
Coords A2_001-A2_004 - line has coords of scheme A2_0XX
more towards valley entrance than A1
profile goes up the valley

B012: End of profile A2
Coords A2_011-A2_014
little bit of snow on the top edge of the sounding

B013: Start of profile A3
Coords A3_001-A3_004 - line has coords of scheme A3_0XX
more towards valley entrance than A2
profile goes downhill in the valley

B019: Start of profile A4
Coords A4_001-A4_004 - line has coords of scheme A4_0XX
more towards valley entrance than A4
profile goes uphill in the valley
little bit of grass in sounding B019

B024: End of profile A4
highest profile, nearest the valley entrance
Coords A4_011-A4_014

B025: Start of profile A5
Coords A5_001-A5_004 - line has coords of scheme A5_0XX
more into valley than A1
profile goes uphill in the valley

profile A5 has slight overlaps with profile A1

B031: Start of profile A6
Coords A6_001-A6_004 - line has coords of scheme A6_0XX
more into valley than A5
profile goes downhill in the valley
### 4 corroded metal pipes with about 3cm diameter and a length of 10m are about 5m away from the top of this sounding
-> see pictures in folder pipes_B031

B036: End of profile A6
Coords A6_011-A6_014
last point of area coverage

### Soundings from area looked quite similar, data looks good at first glance on the V/A-plot
Anomaly was visible on all of the soundings and some area below should be descernible
some soundings showed second batch of negative values at the very end, but with high errors - might be worth further investigation with bigger loop and/or more stackings and longer time key; could also be noise

## Profile P1 follows the ERT/SRT line and attaches directly to the area coverage

B037: Start of profile P1
Coords P1_001-P1_004 - line has coords of scheme P1_0XX
profile attaches to area coverage in the direction of adrians drawing and the ERT/SRT line

B045: End of profile P1
little bit of vegetation, so likely no permafrost
